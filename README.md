# Task Management System

When working on a project either individually, with a team or in an organization a task management tool is essential to complete projects efficiently by organizing and prioritizing related tasks. This task management system is built in order to delegate task to team members and notify them when the deadline is near. Task management system is a system that helps organize, streamline, and prioritize tasks required to achieve a goal or complete a project. Planning and scheduling are the most basic features of a task management system. Planning involves breaking the entire workflow down into simple tasks. Once you have the tasks ready to be assigned, you can set deadlines or set them as recurring tasks. 
Collaboration can be difficult without a system, especially in a remote work environment. Team members can’t rely on spreadsheets for complex tasks, at least without pulling their hair out, because they may have several subtasks, task dependencies, or milestones. 
A robust task management system streamlines team collaboration processes. Team members can exchange information and receive updates about ongoing tasks, and admin can see any about individual tasks and track task progress with a task management system.

Problem of the Statement and Justification 	
A task management system helps you organize work. There’s no way you can keep track of every project task, meet your deadlines, track progress, and manage your team without a dedicated tool. Luckily, task management systems are designed for this, acting as a safeguard against going crazy! It’s a dedicated space to monitor your task progress, assign tasks, and manage schedules. It ensures that you’re able to efficiently track tasks and subtasks so that you meet your deadlines. It also helps your team collaborate effectively.
Task management systems will improve not only your in-office and/or virtual team’s tasks but also your team collaboration capabilities. As each task has a dedicated space, it’s easier for your team to consolidate information and work on things together. Also, as every assignee has access to this task space, nobody will be left out of the loop. Your team can easily share files, ideas, and feedback to collaborate on tasks and get things done quickly. 
Generally, it helps you prioritize tasks especially based on their deadlines. While every task needs to be addressed, some are more important than others.
